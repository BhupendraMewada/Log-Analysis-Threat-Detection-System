# 🚀 Log Analysis & Threat Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Log Analysis & Threat Detection System** is a powerful tool designed to analyze system logs, detect security threats, and identify anomalies using **Machine Learning and Trie-based detection**. The project integrates **FastAPI** for backend processing and an **HTML-based frontend** for user interaction.

## 🛠️ Features
✅ **Real-time Log Analysis** – Detects security threats & anomalies from logs.
✅ **Machine Learning Integration** – Uses **TF-IDF + Random Forest** for anomaly detection.
✅ **Trie-Based Threat Detection** – Quickly identifies predefined threat patterns.
✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface** – Upload log files or manually enter logs for analysis.
✅ **FastAPI Backend** – High-performance backend with API endpoints.
✅ **Secure & Scalable** – Can be extended for corporate-level threat monitoring.
✅ **Web-based Dashboard** – Interactive UI for log insights and security monitoring.
✅ **Automated Alerts** – Real-time notifications for detected threats.
